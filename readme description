●	Extracted data from a JSON including location and descriptions of superfund sites (EPA) and demographics and socioeconomics (Census).  
Cleaned data, selected columns, and uploaded to SQL.  The dashboard that we created showed the geographic dispersal of superfund sites across the nation
through clustering, with the ability to zoom in to the point of getting the specific address for a site.
In addition, a table of metadata was derived including interesting state-level summary statistics, such as level of homeownership vs rentals, what number
didn't have indoor plumbing, and other factors.  Lastly, the three plot visualizations showed the relationships between site score, or how bad a site is, and 
three different variables, such as percent person of color, median household income, and percent without healthcare.
●	Subject Matter Expert and Analyst.  Made visualizations and tables in HTML/JS and made presentation. 
●	Used Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, SQLalchemy, SQL, HTML, JS and d3 on the data.
